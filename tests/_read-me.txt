FastSitePHP Unit Testing Overview

FastSitePHP provides a web based method of testing so that all code and page speed
can be easily confirmed in any environment from a web browser.

To run from a development computer simply browse to the file [index.htm] while running PHP.
The [index.htm] contains a number of options which can changed in JavaScript.

Example Link:
    http://localhost:3000/vendor/fastsitephp/tests/index.htm

If you want to confirm the framework on your server then you will need to move the [tests]
folder to the web root. The command will vary based on your setup, however the below example
works in Linux if the site is installed to [/var/www]. The Unit Tests can provide info on the
environment being used such as the PHP and OS Version plus they will run time consuming task
such as PBKDF2 so after you finish testing on a public server you should delete the folder.

Example Command:
    cp -R /var/www/vendor/fastsitephp/tests /var/www/html/

Then run:
    http://www.example.com/tests/index.htm
