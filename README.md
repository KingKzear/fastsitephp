# üåü Welcome to FastSitePHP!

**Thanks for visiting!**

FastSitePHP is a new web framework that uses PHP. FastSitePHP has been designed for fast performance, coding flexibility, long term stability, ease of use, and a better overall development experience. FastSitePHP is also minimal in size so it quick to download and easy to get started. Although it‚Äôs new (first published in November of 2019) FastSitePHP was written over many years and is extremely stable containing a large number of unit tests.

This repository contains FastSitePHP‚Äôs Framework and main Website.

## üöÄ Getting Started

**Getting started with PHP and FastSitePHP is extremely easy.** If you do not have PHP installed then see instructions for Windows, Mac, and Linux on the getting started page:

<a href="https://www.fastsitephp.com/en/getting-started" target="_blank">https://www.fastsitephp.com/en/getting-started</a>

Once PHP is installed you can launch the site from the command-line as show below or if you use a Code Editor or IDE [Visual Studio Code, GitHub Atom, etc] then you can launch the site directly from your editor. See the above getting started page for more.

~~~
cd {root-directory}
php -S localhost:3000
~~~

To include support for rendering server-side markdown documents or support for crypto functions with older versions of PHP (PHP 5) first run the install script.

~~~
cd {root-directory}
php ./scripts/install.php
~~~

## ü§ù Contributing

**All contributions are welcome.** For major changes including new classes, breaking changes to existing code, updating existing graphics and files, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Some examples of items to contribute:

* Typos and Grammar Mistakes - If you see any please fix and submit.
* Adding additional demo pages - The demo pages typically use more HTML, CSS, and JavaScript than PHP so if you are a web developer and do not know PHP you can easily learn it during development.
* Additional Unit Tests and Testing Methods
* Additional Documentation and Tutorials
* Additional Classes and Features
* New Ideas - If you have ideas on how to improve then please open an issue to discuss.

The [docs/to-do-list.txt] file contains the full list of items that are currently pending and is good place to start.

## <span style="color:green;">$</span> Paid Translators Needed!

**Are you fluent in English and another language? <a href="https://www.fastsitephp.com/en/translators-needed" target="_blank">If so then please get in touch</a>.**

FastSitePHP is looking for paid translators so that it can be translated into multiple languages quickly. Translations can be done in many steps so even if you have just an hour or two it will be enough to help and earn some money.

## :question: FAQ

**Why was FastSitePHP Created?**

The core code for FastSitePHP was started on in 2013 when the lead author was developing a website using PHP. Originally popular PHP Frameworks were compared, tested, and one was initially chosen. However at the time (<a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/" target="_blank">and still now for the most part</a>) most PHP frameworks were extremely slow compared to frameworks in other languages and the PHP language itself.

For the site being developed the framework and components were replaced one by one into separate classes and once all third-party frameworks and classes were removed the site performed 60x faster, used 10x less memory, achieved 100 score on Google speed test, and unexpected server errors went away. Then over a 6-year period the core code was developed into FastSitePHP.

**I already know JavaScript/Node, Python, C#, Java, etc. Why should I learn PHP?**

* PHP is the most widely used programming language in the world for dynamic server-side websites; this includes many of the most popular websites in the world.
* PHP has great documentation and a large community of developers which makes learning and finding resources easy.
* Out of the box database support. All major vendors (Microsoft, Oracle, etc) have supported PHP for years with high performance native database extensions.
* Works in any environment. The latest version of PHP can work on virtually any server or computer. This includes Windows IIS, Linux/Apache, Raspberry Pi, and even legacy IBM Servers.
* Rapid development and server setup - simply make changes to a PHP file and refresh the page. There is no build process to compile programs and no services to stop and restart when making changes.
* Learning additional languages allows for learning new ideas and concepts, and improves your overall programming skills.
* Income - more languages = more money and a better resume. While on average PHP pays less than many other popular languages; large sites, and sites that rely on design firms typically pay top dollar _(high income)_ for PHP development. Having PHP on your resume allows for more opportunities. Additionally if you are paying developers to develop a site PHP can result in a more affordable site.

**How large is FastSitePHP?**

- **Framework** (~19,000 lines of PHP Code, ~430 kb as a zip file)
- **Unit Tests** (~25,000 lines of Code)

**Which versions of PHP are supported?**

All versions of PHP from 5.3 to 7.3.
