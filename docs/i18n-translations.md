# Internationalization (I18N) - Language Translations

## Overview

This document provides a brief overview of changes needed when adding new languages to FastSitePHP. Three different repositories need to be updated for full site translations.

The following setup is recommended for local development.

~~~
fastsitephp     {root-directory}
├── fastsitephp   [repository]
├── playground    [repository]
└── starter-site  [repository]
~~~

If you need to install PHP see documents for (Windows, macOS, and Linux) from: https://www.fastsitephp.com/en/getting-started

Currently specific languages are desired and translation work can be paid. For more see: https://www.fastsitephp.com/en/translators-needed

Files are copied from English, Google Translate is used for initial translations, and then human translators fix errors from Google Translate.

## Generating the files

All needed files can be generated by using the php script once all 3 repositories are downloaded:

https://github.com/fastsitephp/fastsitephp/blob/master/scripts/create-i18n-files.php

Simply change the value for [const LANG_COPY_TO = '{lang}';] on line 18 and run it.

## JSON Files

Files for specific languages end with `*.{lang}.json` and the main file for each site is `_.{lang}.json`.

* `fastsitephp/website/app_data/i18n`
* `starter-site/app_data/i18n`

## Related Nav Menu

Search the following file for `i18n-menu` and `$github`. There are 2 `i18n-menu` menus (one desktop and one mobile). `$github` is used to specify the readme file.

The order of languages for the Nav Menu will be initially based on global internet usage for each language; however this may change in the future:

## Code Playground Template

Each language has it's own template directory/folder. Once a directory is created for a language then it can be used for to create sites. Text content and code comments are updated to the translated language.

`playground\app_data\template\{lang}`

https://github.com/fastsitephp/playground/tree/master/app_data/template

## Home Page Code

Code comments are updated and some text is changed `home-page-{lang}.php`

https://github.com/fastsitephp/fastsitephp/tree/master/website/app_data/sample-code

## Main Site Readme

Some of this content is duplicated from the main home page so some content simply be copied after translating JSON files.

`fastsitephp\docs\i18n-readme\README.{lang}.md`

https://github.com/fastsitephp/fastsitephp/tree/master/docs/i18n-readme

## Code for the Example Pages

Update comments in `*.{lang}.txt` files

https://github.com/fastsitephp/fastsitephp/tree/master/website/app_data/i18n/code

## Quick Reference Code

Code comments are updated and some text is changed `home-page-{lang}-examples.php`. This is a large file so tranlations are planned for the future after many languages are first translated. Additionally `home-page-{lang}.php` should load the new file when created.

## Docs and API

These file are also planned for the future due to the amount of content. The API docs will need a custom UI created in order to edit them as much of the JSON content contains line breaks and formatting.
